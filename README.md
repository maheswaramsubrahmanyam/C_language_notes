## 🚀 Running Your First C Program

Before you begin, ensure you have Turbo C installed and set up.

### Steps to Run

1. Go to: `Start > Turbo C`
2. Open a new project: `File > New`
3. Write the following code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Studyopedia C Language Tutorial"); 
    return 0;
}
```

| Component    | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `#include`   | Preprocessor directive; the first thing read by the compiler |
| `stdio.h`    | Header file containing input/output functions                |
| `int main()` | Main function of the program with return type `int`          |
| `printf`     | Prints formatted strings to standard output                  |
| `return`     | Terminates the function and returns control to the caller    |

⚙️ What is Compilation?<br>
Compilation is a process of converting the source code into object code.<br>
It is done with the help of a compiler. The compiler checks the source code for syntactical or structural errors and generates the object code if the code is error-free.<br>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b1b3b50-642c-4612-bfd6-232ec9eb2059)
<br>


---
🛠️ C Compilation Process <br>
The compilation process can be divided into four steps: <br>

Pre-processing <br>

Compiling <br>

Assembling <br>

Linking <br>

🔸 Preprocessor <br>
Processes directives like #include and #define before actual compilation. <br>

Expands macros and includes header files into the source code. <br>

🔸 Compiler <br>
Translates the expanded code into low-level assembly code. <br>

Performs syntax checking and optimization. <br>

🔸 Assembler <br>
Converts the assembly code into machine-level object code. <br>

Generates a file with a .obj (DOS) or .o (UNIX) extension. <br>

🔸 Linker <br>
Combines the program’s object code with library object code. <br>

Produces the final executable file (.exe for DOS or a.out for UNIX). <br>

###Data Types:<br>
| Type     | Description                     | Example                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `int`    | Integer                         | `int a = 5;`            |
| `float`  | Floating-point (decimal) number | `float b = 0.54;`       |
| `char`   | Single character                | `char c = 'A';`         |
| `string` | Character array (not a keyword) | `char str[] = "Hello";` |


---
📦 Variables in C <br>
Variables are containers for storing data values.<br>

Syntax<br>
```Data_type variable_name = value;```

Data_type: e.g., int, float, char<br>

variable_name: any valid identifier<br>

value: e.g., 99, 0.54, 'c', "text"<br>

```
int num = 10;
float num2 = 0.693;
int a;       // Variable declaration
a = 20;      // Assigning value

```
---
🔠 Format Specifiers <br>
Use format specifiers with printf() to print variable values.<br>
| Data Type | Format Specifier |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| `int`     | `%d`             |
| `float`   | `%f`             |
| `char`    | `%c`             |
| `string`  | `%s`             |

---
🧾 Example Code: Format Specifiers
<br>

```
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 156;
    int d = 25;

    printf("%d \n%d \n", a, d);

    float b = 14.3;
    printf("%f\n", b);

    char c = 'A';
    printf("%c\n", c);

    return 0;
}
```
---
📝 Example Code: Combining Text and Variables

<br>

```#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 156;
    float b = 14.3;
    char c = 'A';

    to combine text and variables, separate them with a comma inside printf()
    printf("My integer value is : %d", a);

    return 0;
}
```



---

💬 Comments in C Language<br<
Comments are used to explain the code. They improve readability and are not part of the execution.<br>

🔹 Single-line Comments<br>
Declared with two forward slashes //

```
// printing hello world using printf() function
printf("Hello World");
```

🔸 Multi-line Comments<br>
Start with /* and end with */<br>
```
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
Used to explain a block of code.
Helps in making the code more understandable.
*/
```


## 🧠 Get the Memory Size of Data Types in C

In the **Data Types** chapter, we learned that the memory size of a variable depends on its type.

### 📊 Common Data Type Sizes

| Data Type | Typical Size      |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `int`     | 2 or 4 bytes       |
| `float`   | 4 bytes            |
| `double`  | 8 bytes            |
| `char`    | 1 byte             |

> 🧩 The **memory size** refers to how much space a type occupies in the computer's memory.

---

## 📏 Using `sizeof` Operator

To get the actual memory size (in bytes) of a data type or variable, use the `sizeof` operator.

### 🔍 Example Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int myInt;
    float myFloat;
    double myDouble;
    char myChar;

    printf("%zu\n", sizeof(myInt));
    printf("%zu\n", sizeof(myFloat));
    printf("%zu\n", sizeof(myDouble));
    printf("%zu\n", sizeof(myChar));

    return 0;
}
```

---
## 🔁 Type Conversion in C

**Type Conversion** is the process of converting one data type into another. This is especially important when performing operations between different types (e.g., integers and floats).

---

### 📦 Example Use Case

Suppose you're dividing two integers:

```c
int a = 5;
int b = 2;
int result;

result = a / b;  // Output: 2 (0.5 is neglected because of integer division)
```
---
🧠 Types of Type Conversion<br>
Type conversions in C are of two types:<br>

Implicit Conversion (Automatic)<br>

Explicit Conversion (Manual)<br>

1️⃣ Implicit Conversion<br>
In implicit conversion, the compiler automatically converts a smaller data type to a larger data type to prevent data loss.<br>

🔍 Example: Implicit Conversion<br>
```
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    float a = 88;  // Integer 88 is implicitly converted to float
    printf("%f", a);
    return 0;
}
```
2️⃣ Explicit Conversion (Type Casting)<br>
In explicit conversion, the programmer manually converts one data type into another using casting.<br>

🔍 Example: Explicit Conversion<br>
```
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b = 2;

    float result = (float) a / b;  // Casting a to float before division
    printf("%f\n", result);

    return 0;
}
```
📝 Note: Using (float) before a variable tells the compiler to treat that variable as a float for the operation.<br>

---

## 🔒 Constants in C

In C programming, if you want to make a variable **constant**—meaning its value should never change throughout the program—you can use the `const` keyword.

### 🧠 What is `const`?

- `const` is a **keyword** used to declare **constant variables**.
- Once declared with `const`, the value of the variable **cannot be modified** later in the program.

---

### 🔍 Example: Constant Variable in C

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    const int a = 10;  // 'a' is a constant and cannot be changed
    printf("%d\n", a);
    return 0;
}
```

##📌 Tip: Constants are especially useful for defining fixed values like PI, maximum limits, configuration settings, etc.<br>

```
const float PI = 3.14;
const int MAX_USERS = 100;
```
---

# ⚙️ Operators in C

**Operators** are used to perform operations on variables and values.

---

## ➕ Basic Operator Example

```c
int myNum = 100 + 50;
```
Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, it can also be used with:
```
int sum1 = 100 + 50;        // 150
int sum2 = sum1 + 250;      // 400
int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;     // 800
```
---
🧩 Types of Operators in C <br>
C divides operators into the following groups:<br>

Arithmetic Operators<br>

Assignment Operators<br>

Comparison Operators<br>

Logical Operators<br>

Bitwise Operators<br>

## ➗ Arithmetic Operators<br>

Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations.<br>

| Operator | Name           | Description                       | Example |
| -------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------- |
| `+`      | Addition       | Adds two values                   | `x + y` |
| `-`      | Subtraction    | Subtracts one value from another  | `x - y` |
| `*`      | Multiplication | Multiplies two values             | `x * y` |
| `/`      | Division       | Divides one value by another      | `x / y` |
| `%`      | Modulus        | Returns the remainder of division | `x % y` |
| `++`     | Increment      | Increases value by 1              | `++x`   |
| `--`     | Decrement      | Decreases value by 1              | `--x`   |


---
## 📝 Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.<br>

```
int x = 10;  // Assigns 10 to x
x += 5;      // Equivalent to x = x + 5;
```
| Operator | Example   | Same As      | 
| -------- | --------- | ------------ |
| `=`      | `x = 5`   | `x = 5`      | 
| `+=`     | `x += 3`  | `x = x + 3`  | 
| `-=`     | `x -= 3`  | `x = x - 3`  |    
| `*=`     | `x *= 3`  | `x = x * 3`  |     
| `/=`     | `x /= 3`  | `x = x / 3`  |      
| `%=`     | `x %= 3`  | `x = x % 3`  |   
| `&=`     | `x &= 3`  | `x = x & 3`  |     
| `        | =`        |  `x          | 
| `^=`     | `x ^= 3`  | `x = x ^ 3`  |   
| `>>=`    | `x >>= 3` | `x = x >> 3` |   
| `<<=`    | `x <<= 3` | `x = x << 3` |    


---

## 🔍 Comparison Operators
Used to compare two values. Returns 1 for true, 0 for false.<br>

```
int x = 5;
int y = 3;

printf("%d", x > y);  // Outputs 1 because 5 > 3
```

| Operator | Name                  | Example  | Description                             |
| -------- | --------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `==`     | Equal to              | `x == y` | True if x is equal to y                 |
| `!=`     | Not equal to          | `x != y` | True if x is not equal to y             |
| `>`      | Greater than          | `x > y`  | True if x is greater than y             |
| `<`      | Less than             | `x < y`  | True if x is less than y                |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal | `x >= y` | True if x is greater than or equal to y |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal    | `x <= y` | True if x is less than or equal to y    |


---

## 🔗 Logical Operators

Used to combine multiple conditions and return true or false.<br>

| Operator | Name | Example              | Description                                |   
| -------- | ---- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | 
| `&&`     | AND  | `x < 5 && x < 10`    | True if **both** conditions are true       |     
| `||`     |  OR  |  `x < 5 || x < 10`   | True if **at least one** condition is true |                               
| `!`      | NOT  | `!(x < 5 && x < 10)` | Reverses the result (true becomes false)   |         


---

# 🔀 Conditions and If Statements in C

C supports logical conditions that allow you to perform different actions based on different decisions.

---

## 📐 Logical Conditions

These are the common logical conditions used in C:

| Condition              | Symbol  |
|------------------------|---------|
| Less than              | `<`     |
| Less than or equal to  | `<=`    |
| Greater than           | `>`     |
| Greater than or equal  | `>=`    |
| Equal to               | `==`    |
| Not equal to           | `!=`    |

---

## 🧠 Conditional Statements in C

C provides the following conditional statements:

- `if` – Executes a block of code if a specified condition is `true`.
- `else` – Executes a block of code if the same condition is `false`.
- `else if` – Specifies a new condition to test if the first condition is `false`.
- `switch` – Selects one of many blocks of code to be executed.

---

## ✅ The `if` Statement

Use the `if` statement to specify a block of code to run when a condition is true.

### 🧾 Syntax

```c
if (condition) {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 7;

    if (a > 5) {
        printf("A is greater than 5 and value of A is: %d\n", a);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
## ```if...else``` Statement
 Syntax<br>
```
if (condition) {
    // block of code if true
} else {
    // block of code if false
}

```
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int time = 20;

    if (time <= 12) {
        printf("Good Morning!");
    } else {
        printf("Good Evening!");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
## ```if...else if...else``` Statement
🧾 Syntax <br>
```
if (condition1) {
    // block of code
} else if (condition2) {
    // block of code
} else if (condition3) {
    // block of code
} else {
    // default block of code
}

```

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int time = 14;

    if ((time >= 1) && (time <= 12)) {
        printf("Good Morning!");
    } else if ((time > 12) && (time < 16)) {
        printf("Good Afternoon!");
    } else if ((time > 16) && (time <= 18)) {
        printf("Good Evening!");
    } else {
        printf("Good Night!");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

---
# ✂ Short Hand If...Else (Ternary Operator)

C also supports a **short-hand version of the `if...else` statement**, known as the **ternary operator**.

It is called **ternary** because it uses **three operands**:
- A condition
- A result if the condition is true
- A result if the condition is false

---

## 🔧 Syntax

```c
variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue : expressionFalse;
```
## Traditional if...else vs Ternary Operator
## Traditional if...else
```
int time = 20;

if (time < 18) {
    printf("Good day.");
} else {
    printf("Good evening.");
}

```
##  Using Ternary Operator
```
int time = 20;

(time < 18) ? printf("Good day.") : printf("Good evening.");
```
📝 Both versions produce the same output. Use whichever is more readable or appropriate for your use case.<br>

- The ternary operator is a cleaner way to write simple if...else conditions.

- Use it when a decision needs to be made between two values or expressions.

- It helps make your code shorter and more concise.

- Tip: Avoid using ternary operators for complex logic — it may reduce code readability.

# Loops in C

Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

Loops are handy because they:

- Save time
- Reduce errors
- Make code more readable
- less code 

## Types of loops in c 
- while loop 
- do while loop
- for loop 
---

## 💡 While Loop

The `while` loop loops through a block of code **as long as a specified condition is true**:

### 🔧 Syntax

```c
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
##example 
```
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {

int i = 0;
while (i<=3) { 
    // i=0 0<=3 true 
    // i=1 1<=3 true 
    // i=2 2<=3 true
    // i=3 3<=3 true
    // i=4 4<=3 false 
    printf("%d \n",i); // 0 1 2 3
    i++; 
    // i+1 => 0+1 i=>1
    // i+1 => 1+1 i=>2
    // i+1 => 2+1 i=>3
    // i+1 => 3+1 i=>4
}

}
```
**Note: Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition (i++), otherwise the loop will never end!**
## Why Use i?
We often use i as a loop counter because it's short, traditional, and stands for 'index' or 'iterator'.

## Countdown Example
This example counts down from 3 to 1 and then displays "Happy New Year!!" at the end:
 
```
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    
    int countdown = 3;
    while (countdown>0) { 
        printf("%d \n", countdown);
        countdown --; // 
    }
    printf("Happy New Year!!");
}
```

## The Do/While Loop
The `do/while loop` is a variant of the `while loop`. It executes the block of code once before checking the condition.
```
do {
  // code block to be executed
} while (condition);
```

## example 

```
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    
int i = 0;
do {
    printf("%d \n",i);
    i++;
}while (i<5);//true  

}
```
## Event the condition is false it excute once becouse do while loop excite onnce even condition is false 
```
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    
int i = 0;
do {
    printf("%d \n",i);
    i++;
}while (i>10);//false 

}
```

# C `for` Loop Examples

## Introduction

When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the `for` loop instead of a `while` loop.

### Syntax

```c
for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
- Expression 1 is executed once before the loop starts.

- Expression 2 defines the condition for running the loop.

- Expression 3 is executed after each iteration of the loop.

# Examples
# 1. Print Numbers from 0 to 4
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   
  for(int i=0; i<=5; i++){ // i+1  i=0+1 =>i =1 +1 => i=2 +1 => i=3+1 
    printf("%d\n",i);
  }
}
```
# Explanation:

- Statement 1: int i = 0; sets a variable before the loop starts.

- Statement 2: i < 5; checks the loop condition.

- Statement 3: i++ increments the value after each iteration.

#  Sum of Numbers from 1 to 5

```
//sum of numbers from 1 to 5 

// 1 + 2 +  3 +  4 + 5 =15
#include <stdio.h>
int i;
int sum=0;
int main() {
   
   for(i=0; i<=5; i++){
       sum = sum + i;
       // sum = 0 
       // 0+1 =1 sum = 0+1 =1 
       // 1+1 =2 sum = 1+2 =3
       // 2+1 =3 sum = 3+3 =6
       // 3+1 =4 sum = 6+4 =10
       // 4+1 =5 sum =10+5 =15
       // 5  doesn't excute 
       printf("%d\n",sum);
   }
   printf("------------------\n");
   printf("finnal answer: ");
   printf("%d",sum);
}
```
